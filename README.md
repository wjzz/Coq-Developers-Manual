# Coq Developer's Manual

File started by Wojciech Jedynak during February 2014.

## About

This 'manual' documents my learning process as I study and explore the OCaml source code of the Coq Proof Assistant. My immediate goal for this document was to find a good way to organize the information about the project and so far it seems to work for me. However, I hope that after a while these notes will become fairly comprehensive and that they will make it easier for newcomers to dive into the project. Suggestions and comments are most welcome!

For starters I began with the latest release (Coq 8.4pl3). My plan is to focus on that version until I become somewhat oriented in the project -- this should take a few months. After that I will create a branch and update the contents of the manual for the trunk version.
